# Theo Kremer's Portfolio Website
This github represents the code that runs my portfolio site over at 
> https://www.ttkremer.com

All content and animations were created by me

# Overview
This website contains all the information a recruiting manager would be interested in reading as it displays my skills and abilities in a well-rounded and creatively coded website. I focused on including animations along every step of the way to ensure the website had movement in to it. I believe this helps the visitor feel intrguied enough to continue scrolling and read more information about me.
